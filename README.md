# Weather API Integration in Spring Boot

This project demonstrates how to integrate an external weather API into a Spring Boot application. It uses `RestTemplate` to fetch weather data from the Weather API and maps the response to Java DTOs for further processing.

---

## Features
- Fetches real-time weather information for any city.
- Maps JSON response to custom DTOs using Jackson annotations.
- Clean, modular structure for maintainable code.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (17+)
- **Spring Boot** (3.x)
- **Lombok** for boilerplate code generation.
- **RestTemplate** for REST API calls.
- **WeatherAPI** for real-time weather data.
